This error occurs when you try to use a method or property of an object that has not been properly initialized or has been deallocated.  This often happens when you try to access an object after it has been released or if you attempt to use an object that was never allocated in the first place.  Another scenario is accessing an object's property before its `init` or `initWith...` method has properly set that property's value.
